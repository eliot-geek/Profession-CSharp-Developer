# Task: Removing Adjacent Character Multiples

Create a method that accepts text and returns a new text where adjacent character multiples are reduced to a single occurrence.

## Description

1. Implement a method that takes a text input.

2. Examine the text and find adjacent character multiples.

3. Reduce the adjacent character multiples to a single occurrence while keeping the original order.

4. Return the resulting text.

## Example

Input Text 1: "WEEEEATTTTTTHEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR"
Resulting Text 1: "WEATHER"

Input Text 2: "WWWONNNDEEEFUULLL DDDDAAAAAAYYY"
Resulting Text 2: "WONDERFUL DAY"

The program should accept a text, process it to remove adjacent character multiples, and return the modified text.

The method ensures that adjacent character multiples are reduced, retaining the original order.
