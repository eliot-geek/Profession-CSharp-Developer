# 11. Deep Dive into OOP. Part 1

## 11.1 OOP Terminology: Class, Structure, Interface, Inheritance
### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding Terminology, Classes, Structures, Interfaces, and the Pillars of OOP
#### Ideological Foundations of Object-Oriented Programming
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

#### Class in Object-Oriented Programming
- Blueprint for creating objects
- Describes structure and algorithms

#### Object (Instance of a Class)
- Entity in the digital space
- Possesses state and behavior
- Has fields and methods
  
#### Attributes in Object-Oriented Programming
- Data members
- Instance variables

#### Attributes (Variable-Member, Data Member, Class Field, Instance Variable) in OOP
- Represent the state of an object
- Also known as data members or instance variables

#### Interfaces
- Data types without implementation
- Inherited by classes for method implementation

#### Why Interfaces are Necessary
- Define a type with attributes and methods
- Enable multiple inheritance

#### Inheritance of Interfaces
- A mechanism in OOP languages
- Allows a class to inherit multiple interfaces

#### Abstract Classes
- Classes without implementation for one or more methods

#### Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming
- Modularity
- Flexibility
- Time Savings

#### Disadvantages of Object-Oriented Programming
- Steep Learning Curve
- Performance Impact
- Increased Code Size
