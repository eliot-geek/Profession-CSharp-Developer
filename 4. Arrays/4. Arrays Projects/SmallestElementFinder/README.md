# Task Description

## Task: Write a C# program to collect a sequence of integers from the user, determine the smallest element in the sequence, and display the received sequence along with the smallest element.

## Description

1. Prompt the user with a message to input the length of the sequence.

2. Read the user's input for the length of the sequence and store it in a variable named "quantity."

3. Create an array of integers with a size equal to the user-defined sequence length.

4. Use a for loop to read the user's input for each integer in the sequence and store them in the array.

5. Print the sequence of integers that the user inputted.

6. Initialize the minimum value to the first element of the sequence.

7. Use a for loop to iterate through each element of the sequence and update the minimum value if a smaller element is found.

8. Print the minimum value.

9. Display the received sequence along with the smallest element.

10. Wait for user input to exit the program.

The program takes user input to define a sequence of integers and finds the smallest element in the sequence, displaying both the sequence and the smallest element to the user.
