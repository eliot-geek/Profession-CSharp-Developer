# **Control Structures: Branching And Loops**

## **The topic refers to the fundamental programming concepts related to controlling the flow of execution in a code.**
**These control structures allow you to make decisions, execute specific code blocks repeatedly, and create more dynamic and responsive applications.**

## **Conditional Statements (Branching):**
**if Statements:**  
Learn how to use conditional "if" statements to execute different code blocks based on a condition. Understand the syntax and how to write various conditions.  
**else and else if Statements:**  
Explore how to handle multiple conditions using "else" and "else if" branches to create branching logic.  
**Switch Statements:**  
Understand how "switch" statements work, allowing you to choose one code block from several options based on the value of an expression.

## **Loops (Iteration):**  
**for Loops:**  
Learn how to create "for" loops to repeat a block of code a specified number of times. Explore loop initialization, condition, and iteration.  
**while and do-while Loops:**  
Understand the use of "while" and "do-while" loops for repeating code until a certain condition is met.  
**foreach Loops:**  
Discover how to iterate over collections like arrays or lists using "foreach" loops.  
**Loop Control Statements:**  
Explore control statements like "break" and "continue" to control the flow within loops. Learn how to exit a loop prematurely or skip specific iterations.  
**Nested Control Structures:**  
Understand how to combine conditional statements and loops to create more complex control structures. This can be useful for solving a wide range of problems.
