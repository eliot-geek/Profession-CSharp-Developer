# Matrix Multiplication

Create a method that accepts two matrices and returns their product.

## Description

1. Implement a method that takes two matrices as input.
2. Verify that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix, as this is a requirement for matrix multiplication.
3. Multiply the matrices according to the rules of matrix multiplication.
4. Return the resulting matrix.

## Example

```

| 1  3  5 |   | 1  3  4 |   | 22  48  57 |
| 4  5  7 | x | 2  5  6 | = | 35  79  95 |
| 5  3  1 |   | 3  6  7 |   | 14  36  45 |

```
