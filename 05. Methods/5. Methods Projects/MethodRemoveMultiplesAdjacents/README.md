# Removing Adjacent Character Multiples

## Description

Create a method that takes text as input and returns a new text where adjacent character multiples are reduced to a single occurrence.

1. Implement a method that accepts a text input.
2. Examine the text and identify adjacent character multiples.
3. Reduce adjacent character multiples to a single occurrence while preserving the original order.
4. Return the resulting text.

### Example

**Input Text 1:** "WEEEEATTTTTTHEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRR"  
**Resulting Text 1:** "WEATHER"

**Input Text 2:** "WWWONNNDEEEFUULLL DDDDAAAAAAYYY"  
**Resulting Text 2:** "WONDERFUL DAY"

The program should receive a text, process it to eliminate adjacent character multiples, and return the modified text.

The method ensures that adjacent character multiples are reduced while maintaining the original order.
