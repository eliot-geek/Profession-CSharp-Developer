# **Introduction**

## **An introduction to the profession of a .NET Developer involves understanding the role, responsibilities, and the skills required to excel in this field.**

**.NET is a popular framework developed by Microsoft for building a wide range of applications, including web, desktop, mobile, and cloud-based applications.**

1. Understanding of .NET Framework: .NET framework and its various components, including the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and the .NET Class Library.
2. Programming Languages: .NET supports multiple programming languages, including C#, VB.NET, F#, and more. C# is the most widely used language for .NET development.
3. Development Environments: Set up and use development environments like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or JetBrains Rider. These are powerful tools that make .NET development easier and more efficient.
4. Core Concepts: Object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and design patterns.
5. Web Development: ASP.NET Core for building web applications. MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, routing, how to create responsive and secure web applications.
6. Desktop Development: Explore Windows Forms or Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for creating Windows applications. These technologies are commonly used for building desktop software.
7. Mobile Development: Xamarin or .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) can be valuable. These frameworks allow you to write cross-platform mobile apps using C# and .NET.
8. Database Integration: ADO.NET framework provides a set of classes and libraries for connecting to, querying, and manipulating databases. Alseo databases, including SQL Server, MySQL, or other database systems.
9. API Development: Explore how to build RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API. API development is essential for creating services that interact with web and mobile applications.
10. Testing and Debugging: Develop skills in testing code and debugging issues effectively. Learn about unit testing frameworks like NUnit or MSTest and debugging tools available.

## **1.2 IDE Installation and Workspace Configuration**

**Visual Studio**  
**Advantages:**  
Official: Since both the language and development environment are created by Microsoft, it is logical to assume that you won't find anything more functional. In some cases, Visual Studio is indispensable, for example, when using UWP and WPF technologies.
Free: The Community edition versions are sufficient for the average user. Moreover, you can now install plugins (unlike the old Express version).
Functional: Visual Studio has many high-quality plugins. With their help, you can extend the functionality of the application and integrate other languages.
Supports .NET Platforms: Visual Studio has extensive capabilities for developing Windows applications, including in the .NET segment.
Cloud Storage: Register in the Visual Studio community and get access to cloud storage for project files.
Corporate Collaboration: The backlog technology allows team members to collaborate in agile development methodologies.

**Disadvantages:**  
Bugs when transitioning from trial versions: When transitioning to the paid version, settings may be lost, and the corporate server's operation may be disrupted.
Complexity: It won't be easy for a novice to learn Visual Studio on their own — there are too many available features hidden in submenu sections.

**Visual Studio Code**  
**Advantages:**  
Cross-Platform: It works on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows. Currently unavailable on Android and iOS.
Free: A simple open-source editor and plugins—no need to pay.
Lightweight: You'll need very few resources to start working with the minimalist VSC.

**Disadvantages:**  
Low Functionality: Despite support for the .NET platform, VCS is inconvenient for complex projects.
Questionable Reliability: Many add-ons have low build quality and do not always perform even basic functions.
