# **Task 1**
**What needs to be done**  
Programmers have a tradition â€” the first application in a new programming language welcomes the world. Let's welcome the world in C#.

**To complete the task:**

Install the Visual Studio IDE.  
Create a new console application.  
Add an output statement to the Console screen.WriteLine and use it to print the inscription: Hello World!!!  
Add a Console.ReadKey, so that the application does not close when the execution is completed.
