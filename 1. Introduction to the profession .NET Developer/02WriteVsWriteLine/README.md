# **Task 2**

**Task Goal: Understand the difference between Console.Write and Console.WriteLine methods in C#.**

## Task Description:
Write a C# console application that demonstrates the difference between the Console.Write and Console.WriteLine methods. Follow the steps below:

1. Use the Console.Write method to display the message "Hello World!!!" on the console screen. Use three separate method calls, one for each word, and add spaces between the words to avoid them sticking together.
2. Use the Console.WriteLine method to display the same message "Hello World!!!" on the console screen.
3. Add a Console.ReadLine statement to prevent the console window from closing after the program executes.

Note: To close the application, the user needs to press the Enter key.
