# **Task**

The customer has requested a program called 'Notebook.' The payment is fixed at $120.

In this program, there should be a possibility to change the values of several variables to personalize the data output for a specific user. To do this, you need to:

1. Create several variables of different types to store data, such as name, age, height, and grades in three subjects: history, mathematics, and Russian language.

2. Implement an automatic calculation of the average score for the three subjects specified in point 1.

3. Implement the possibility of printing information on the console using:

    - Normal output.
    - Formatted output.
    - String interpolation.

4. The entire code must be commented using regular and XML comments.

5. As a bonus, for an additional fee of $50, the customer has requested the ability to display data in the center of the console.
