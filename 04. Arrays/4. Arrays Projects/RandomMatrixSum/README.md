# Random Matrix

## Task Description

Create an application that displays a matrix of a given size on the screen and fills it with random numbers.

The detailed algorithm for the application is as follows:

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of rows for the matrix.
2. Prompt the user to enter the number of columns for the matrix.
3. Create a matrix of the specified size in memory.
4. Fill the matrix with random integers using the `Random` class.
5. Display the generated matrix on the screen.
6. Display the sum of all elements of this matrix on the screen in a separate line.

## Recommendation

Use nested loops to work with matrices.

## What is Evaluated

The program should display a randomly created matrix of a predetermined size and also show the sum of all elements in the matrix.
