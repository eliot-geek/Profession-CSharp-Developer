# Task 3: Checking for Duplicates

## What to Do
The user enters a number. The number is stored in a HashSet collection. If such a number already exists in the collection, the user is informed that the number was entered previously. If the number is not in the collection, a message appears indicating that the number has been successfully saved.

## Tips and Recommendations
To add a number to a HashSet, use the [`Add`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1.add?view=net-6.0) method.

## What Is Evaluated
The program uses a HashSet as the collection.
